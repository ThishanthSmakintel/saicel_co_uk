                    <p>Generally, homes built between 1930 and 1995 have empty cavity walls. Cavity wall insulation simply
                        involves filling the cavity with an insulating material, usually by drilling small holes in the wall
                        and injecting the insulating material until the cavity is filled. Depending on the size of your home
                        this process usually takes around 2-3 hours.</p>
                    <p>Costs can be as low as £149 (or free if you qualify) and you can save you up to £270 on your energy
                        bills.</p>

                    <h3 class="column-title"><strong>Loft Insulation</strong></h3>
                    <p>Loft insulation is an effective way to save energy and money on your energy bills and can cost as
                        little as £149 (or free if you qualify). The current recommended level of loft insulation is 270mm
                        (10.5"). If you have less than this or if you have no loft insulation at all you can benefit by
                        losing less heat through your roof.</p>
                    <p>Insulating your loft, simply involves laying rolls of mineral wool fibre (or some other insulating
                        material) between and across the joists in your roof space and the work usually takes around 1-2
                        hours depending on the size of your property.</p>

                    <p>*£390 savings a year figure is for 1940's 3 bed semi detached home with a ten year old gas boiler
                        and a gas price of 3.73p/kWh, when cavity wall insulation and loft insulation are installed.
                        More modern homes save less. Individual savings depend on a large number of factors and the £390
                        quoted should be treated as a guide;</p>
