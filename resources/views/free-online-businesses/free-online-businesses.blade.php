                        <p>Affiliate marketing is a performance-based marketing strategy where publishers promote products
                            and services on behalf of advertisers. As a publisher, you can earn a commission for each sale
                            or action generated through your promotional content. Platforms support this process by
                            administering payment, supplying resources, tracking technology, and providing access to a
                            global network of brands.</p>

                            <li>This reward model is commonly known as Cost Per Action (CPA), which is more transparent than
                                the Cost Per Click (CPC) model.</li>
